  <h1>SAoIP Voice Calibration</h1>
  <div>
    <p>
      In this phase we are going to have you record your voice as you read a
      collection of sentences. We will then have you upload the recording to a
     folder provided to you in an email.

    <p>
      To get started, do the following:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>Find a quiet environment</p> - Try to find a quiet place that you can speak
	at your normal voice, such as your room.  Try to eliminate background noise if you can,
	and avoid places without wind. For instance, try closing the window.
      </li>
      <li><p><b>Set up your headset/microphone</b> Please plug in and turn on your gaming
	headset or microphone and test it out on your computer to make sure the volume
	levels are good. <b>Check that your headset/microphone is set to your preferred system input</b>.
	</p>
	<p> Please try to use a wired/built-in USB microphone or headset instead of a Bluetooth one,
	  as bluetooth headsets tend to record audio in lower quality which can confuse the system.
	</p>
      </li>
      <li><b>Use Chrome</b> - Open this website in a Chrome browser if you can. This will make sure
	the recording app works as intended.
      </li>
      <li><b>Make a test recording</b> - Hit the red Record button below.
	Chrome will ask you for permission to use your microphone.
	Click on "Allow" on the popup box.
	Speak one or two sentences, stop the recording and listen to the recorded result.  Adjust your microphone so that your voice is clear.
      </li>
      <li><b>Make your main recording</b></li>
      </ol>
