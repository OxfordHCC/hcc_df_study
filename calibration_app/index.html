		<h2>Instructions</h2>
		<p>
		  Hello! In this phase, we are going to have you record your voice as you read a
		  collection of sentences. We will then have you upload the recording to a
		  folder provided to you in an email, which we will use to calibrate the AI model.

		<p>
		  To get started, do please follow these simple steps:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li><b>Use Chrome</b>--Please use Chrome to access this website if you can. This will make sure
				the recording app works as intended.	  </li>	
		  <li><b>Find a quiet environment</b> - Try to find a quiet place that you can speak
			at your normal voice, such as your room.  Try to eliminate background noise if you can,
			and avoid places without wind. For instance, try closing the window.
		  </li>
		  <li>
			<p><b>Set up your headset/microphone</b>--Please plug in and turn on your gaming
			  headset or microphone and test it out on your computer to make sure the volume
			  levels are good, and that it is set to your preferred system input.
			</p>
			<p> <b>Avoid bluetooth:</b>--Please try to use a wired/built-in USB microphone or headset instead of a Bluetooth one,
			  	as bluetooth headsets tend to record audio in lower quality which can confuse the system.
			</p>
			<p> <b>Beware of echo</b>--Try to use as close as possible to your microphone as possible. Especially if you are using
				a built-in laptop mic, speak directly into your laptop. Otherwise you will pick up lots	of echo.
			</p>
		  </li>
		  <li><b>Make a test recording</b>--Hit the red Record button below.	Chrome will ask you for permission to use your microphone.
			Click on "Allow" on the popup box. <br>
			<img class="popup" style="width:300px; border:1px solid #222;" src="img/hcc-use-microphone.png"><br>
			Speak one or two sentences, stop the recording and listen to the recorded result.  
			Adjust your microphone so that your voice is clear.
		  </li>
		  <li>
			  <b>Check your audio device</b>--If your audio sounded muffled, the wrong audio device might be selected.
			  Click the little microphone icon in the right side of your URL bar. Then, select the Manage devices setting,
			  then make sure your preferred microphone is selected.
			  <img class="popup" src="img/select-device.png" style="width:90%; border:1px solid #222;" >			  
		  </li>
		  <li><b>Make your main recording</b> - Hit Record once again. Read all the sentences one after another without a pause.  One you are done, hit Stop, and listen to the result.  If it sounds clear, click the wav file link under the audio player that popped up. This will save the file to your computer.  Upload this file to the folder provided to you in the e-mail we sent.</li>
		</ol>
	  </div>
	  <div id="sentences">
		<div>Hit <b>Record</b> below, then read the following sentences using your normal voice, one after another without a break. 
			If you make a mistake, hit stop, and start over.  If you find it hard making a single recording with all the sentences,
			you can take a few sentences as a time in separate recordings, but make sure to upload them all at the end!</div>
